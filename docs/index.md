## The Problem We Solve

Every time we start a new development project, we face the same frustrating cycle:

- Install Node.js and npm for frontend tools
- Set up Python and pip/uv for scripts and automation
- Configure Go for backend services
- Manage Rust toolchain for system tools
- Deal with version conflicts and PATH issues

**With the rise of MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, this problem has become even more pronounced. Many MCP servers require `uvx` for Python tools and `npx` for Node.js packages.

## Our Solution

```bash
# Instead of learning and managing multiple tools:
npx create-react-app my-app     # Requires Node.js setup
uvx ruff check .                # Requires Python/UV setup
go run main.go                  # Requires Go installation

# Just use vx with the same commands you already know:
vx npx create-react-app my-app  # Auto-installs Node.js if needed
vx uvx ruff check .             # Auto-installs UV if needed
vx go run main.go               # Auto-installs Go if needed
```
